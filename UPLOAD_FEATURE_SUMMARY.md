# Google Drive Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Google Drive upload functionality for the Buzzboard Mobile MVP. The feature allows users to upload processed content to Google Drive with post-idea centric organization and editor notes.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Google Drive Service** (`src/lib/services/google-drive.ts`)
  - Folder creation with client/date structure
  - File upload functionality
  - Notes file creation
  - Folder sharing capabilities
  - Ready for real Google OAuth integration

- **Upload API Routes** (`src/app/api/uploads/route.ts`)
  - POST endpoint for file uploads
  - GET endpoint for fetching uploaded files
  - Authentication checks
  - Form data processing
  - Mock implementation ready for real Google Drive integration

### 2. Type System & API Integration
- **Enhanced Types** (`src/lib/types/shoots.ts`)
  - `UploadedFile` interface
  - `UploadProgress` interface
  - `UploadRequest` interface
  - `DriveFolder` interface

- **Extended API Functions** (`src/lib/api/shoots.ts`)
  - `uploadFile()` - Upload with progress tracking
  - `getUploadedFiles()` - Fetch uploaded files
  - `createDriveFolder()` - Create Google Drive folders
  - `shareDriveFolder()` - Generate shareable links

### 3. UI Components (Following Established Patterns)

#### File Upload Zone (`src/components/ui/file-upload-zone.tsx`)
- Drag & drop functionality
- File validation (type, size)
- File preview with thumbnails
- Touch-friendly mobile interface
- Accessibility support

#### Upload Progress (`src/components/ui/upload-progress.tsx`)
- Real-time progress tracking
- Status indicators (uploading, completed, failed, paused)
- Pause/resume/retry functionality
- Mobile-optimized controls

#### Upload Content Form (`src/components/shoots/upload-content-form.tsx`)
- Post-idea centric organization
- Individual upload zones per post idea
- Editor notes per post idea
- Miscellaneous files section
- Google Drive folder structure preview
- Uses established FormSheet pattern

### 4. Integration with Existing Features
- **Shoot Details Page** (`src/app/shoots/[id]/page.tsx`)
  - "Upload" button for completed shoots
  - Seamless integration with existing UI
  - Follows established header action patterns

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Approach
- Touch-friendly drag & drop zones
- Bottom sheet forms using FormSheet pattern
- Optimized for mobile file selection
- Responsive progress indicators

### Post-Idea Centric Organization
- Each post idea has its own upload section
- Individual editor notes per post idea
- Organized file structure in Google Drive
- Clear visual separation between post ideas

### Google Drive Folder Structure
```
Client Name/
└── [YYYY-MM-DD] Shoot Title/
    ├── [Post Idea 1 Title]/
    │   ├── raw-files/
    │   └── notes.txt
    ├── [Post Idea 2 Title]/
    │   ├── raw-files/
    │   └── notes.txt
    └── misc-files/
        └── notes.txt
```

### Error Handling & User Experience
- Progress tracking with pause/resume
- Retry functionality for failed uploads
- Clear error messages
- Optimistic UI updates
- Toast notifications for feedback

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Following Established Patterns
- **DRY Principle**: All upload functions centralized in `shootsApi`
- **FormSheet Pattern**: Upload forms use existing FormSheet component
- **useAsync Hook**: All async operations use established pattern
- **Error Boundaries**: Upload components wrapped in ErrorBoundary
- **Loading States**: LoadingSpinner and Skeleton components
- **Toast Notifications**: Sonner for upload status updates

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Proper interface definitions
- Type-safe API calls
- Generic upload progress handling

### Performance Considerations
- Resumable uploads for large files (ready for implementation)
- Progress tracking without blocking UI
- Optimistic updates during upload
- Efficient file validation

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Ready for Testing
- All components compile successfully
- Development server running
- Upload interface accessible from completed shoots
- Mock API endpoints functional

### 🔄 Mock Implementation
- Google Drive service returns mock data
- File uploads simulate progress
- Folder creation simulated
- Ready for real Google OAuth integration

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Implementation)

### Phase 3: Google OAuth Integration
1. Add Google provider to NextAuth.js config
2. Configure Google API credentials
3. Replace mock service with real Google Drive API
4. Test end-to-end upload flow

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. Batch upload operations
2. Upload queue management
3. Background upload capability
4. File preview thumbnails
5. Upload retry with exponential backoff

### Phase 5: Production Optimization
1. Resumable uploads for large files
2. Upload compression
3. Error logging and monitoring
4. Performance optimization

## 📱 User Flow

1. **Navigate to Completed Shoot**
   - User goes to shoot details page
   - Sees "Upload" button for completed shoots

2. **Open Upload Interface**
   - Tap Upload button
   - Bottom sheet opens with post-idea sections

3. **Upload Content**
   - Drag & drop files into post-idea sections
   - Add editor notes for each post idea
   - Upload miscellaneous files if needed

4. **Track Progress**
   - Real-time progress bars
   - Status updates via toast notifications
   - Pause/resume capability

5. **Completion**
   - Google Drive folder created automatically
   - Files organized by post idea
   - Editor notes saved as text files
   - Shareable folder links generated
